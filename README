Songride is an application which generates per-user statistics from which
country the artists are coming from that were played.

It made up of four components:

1. NodeJS web interface written in CoffeeScript for user interaction
2. Ruby worker to fetch and prepare the data used for statistics generation
3. Analyzer which generates statistics and (tries to) determine the country of
   the artists (written in Haskell)
4. MongoDB storage for all data used in the other three components

== Database management ==

=== Rebuild cleaned data ===

Just run the following command which removes all timestamps:
db.users.update({}, {$unset: {"updated_at":1}}, false, true)
